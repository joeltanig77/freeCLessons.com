    Arrays in C
</h1>

<h2>
    &nbsp;Introduction
</h2>

<p>In this section you will learn about one of the most important data structures in C and that is Arrays.
    This lesson will be split up into subsections so feel free to skip around.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;What is an Array</h2>

<p>An array is a data structure that can contain one type of data type which can include integers, characters (which are also called strings),
 and structs. An array is like a "bucket set" that can store a defined data type. Below is an visualization of what that
    an array would look like if stored the numbers 1, 2, 5, 7, 33, 55, 77 into my array.
</p>
<h3>&nbsp;Integer Array</h3>
<!--TODO: Place image here-->

<p>The associated code that is used to make the drawing above would look like...</p>

<pre>
    int myArray[10]; // Declare an array and define the size of the array
    myArray[0] = 1;  // The first spot in an Array always starts at index 0
    myArray[1] = 2;
    myArray[2] = 5;
    myArray[3] = 7;
    myArray[4] = 33;
    myArray[5] = 55;
    myArray[6] = 77;
    // Spots 7, 8, 9, and 10 will all be set to null or '\0' as nothing was filled
</pre>


<p>What we did above was define our array of 10 spots and filled in the numbers we wanted with
the associated indexes. What makes an array so great is the flexibility of overwriting data at a certain index at any time
and how it its a central data structure on if you need to store multiple pieces of data at once that all relate to one another.
</p>

<p>To declare an array the set-up is always...</p>

<pre>
    type nameVar[size]; // First spot in an array is always 0
</pre>

<p>Let's do another example, let's say we need to change index 5 to the number 44 instead and retrieve the numbers
 from indexes 1 to 6 which we will store in a variable to do stuff with, our code would now look like...
</p>

<pre>
    myArray[5] = 44
    for (int i = 1; i < 7; i++) {
        int myNumber = myArray[i];
        // myNumber would contain the numbers 2, 5, 7, 33, 44, 77 after each iteration of the for loop
    }
</pre>

<p>For our last example of integer arrays, you can also loop though an empty array and define numbers based on a pattern
    set up up by that loop. To show this let us make an array of size 50 that stores only even numbers. Instead of making
    our life hard and going to each index one at a time placing each even number in our array, let's use a for
    loop and a count variable to do our hard work instead.</p>

<pre>
    int count = 2;
    int evenNumbers[50];
    for (int i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
        evenNumbers[i] = count; // store the even numbers starting from index 0
        count += 2 // increment by 2
    }
</pre>
<p><strong>Note: It is important to you define a size big enough for the data you want to store, it is okay to
overestimate the size as it will not break your program. This is important as if you try and access a spot in
an array that does not exist you will get the error, "index out of bounds" </strong></p>

<h3>&nbsp;Character Array</h3>

<p>In C the equivalent to a string data type is a character array. Treat it the same as a integer array but instead of
storing integers, we store the data type character instead in which we can manipulate as well. Below is a visualization below
 of a character array filled with the phrase, "Like a game" </p>
