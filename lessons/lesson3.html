<h1>
    &nbsp;Arrays in C
</h1>

<h2>
    &nbsp;Introduction
</h2>

<p>In this section you will learn about one of the most important data structures in C and that is Arrays.
    This lesson will be split up into subsections so feel free to skip around.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;What is an Array</h2>

<p>An array is a data structure that can contain one type of data type which can include integers, characters (which are also called strings),
 and structs. An array is like a "bucket set" that can store a defined data type. Below is an visualization of what that
    an array would look like if stored the numbers 1, 2, 5, 7, 33, 55, 77 into my array.
</p>
<h3>&nbsp;Integer Array</h3>
<!--TODO: Place image here-->

<p>The associated code that is used to make the drawing above would look like...</p>

<pre>
    int myArray[10]; // Declare an array and define the size of the array
    myArray[0] = 1;  // The first spot in an Array always starts at index 0
    myArray[1] = 2;
    myArray[2] = 5;
    myArray[3] = 7;
    myArray[4] = 33;
    myArray[5] = 55;
    myArray[6] = 77;
    // Spots 7, 8, 9, and 10 will all be set to null or '\0' as nothing was filled
</pre>


<p>What we did above was define our array of 10 spots and filled in the numbers we wanted with
the associated indexes. What makes an array so great is the flexibility of overwriting data at a certain index at any time
and how it its a central data structure on if you need to store multiple pieces of data at once that all relate to one another.
</p>

<p>To declare an array the set-up is always...</p>

<pre>
    type nameVar[size]; // First spot in an array is always 0
</pre>

<p>Let's do another example, let's say we need to change index 5 to the number 44 instead and retrieve the numbers
 from indexes 1 to 6 which we will store in a variable to do stuff with, our code would now look like...
</p>

<pre>
    myArray[5] = 44
    for (int i = 1; i < 7; i++) {
        int myNumber = myArray[i];
        // myNumber would contain the numbers 2, 5, 7, 33, 44, 77 after each iteration of the for loop
    }
</pre>

<p>For our last example of integer arrays, you can also loop though an empty array and define numbers based on a pattern
    set up up by that loop. To show this let us make an array of size 50 that stores only even numbers. Instead of making
    our life hard and going to each index one at a time placing each even number in our array, let's use a for
    loop and a count variable to do our hard work instead.</p>

<pre>
    int count = 2;
    int evenNumbers[50];
    for (int i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
        evenNumbers[i] = count; // store the even numbers starting from index 0
        count += 2 // increment by 2
    }
</pre>
<p><strong>Note: It is important to you define a size big enough for the data you want to store, it is okay to
overestimate the size as it will not break your program. This is important as if you try and access a spot in
an array that does not exist you will get the error, "index out of bounds" </strong></p>

<h3>&nbsp;Character Array</h3>

<p>In C the equivalent to a string data type is a character array. Treat it the same as a integer array but instead of
storing integers, we store the data type character instead in which we can manipulate as well. Below is a visualization below
 of a character array filled with the phrase, "Like a game" </p>

<!--TODO: Place image here-->


<p>The associated code that is used to make the drawing above would look like...</p>
<pre>
    char myPhrase[15];
    strcpy(myPhrase,"Like a game");

</pre>
<p>The reason we use strcpy is because we need to iterate the string variable character by character and the built in
function strcpy does that for us. We will talk more about this in the <a href="lesson6.html">C library lesson</a> </p>
<p>Just like integer array's you can also do the above examples by iterating through
a for loop or even overwriting a certain index and changing a letter as you see fit. You can also delete letters
 of a string by placing a null terminated string. Below is an example of that</p>

<pre>
    char myPhrase[15];
    strcpy(myPhrase,"Like a game");
    for(int i = 7; i < 10; i ++) {
        myPhrase[i] = "/0";
    }
    // myPhrase will now be the string "Like a"
</pre>
<p>There are many uses for an array and in later lessons we shall provide challenges that practice these skills of creating
an array, manipulating an array, and finally using an array</p>

<h2>&nbsp;2D Arrays</h2>
<p>A 2D array is an array structure that is set up as a "grid". The coordinates of the array are set where the top left
is represented as the coordinate 0,0 and the bottom right is represented as the [max][max] assuming max is the
max integer you define as the max size of the 2D array. Below is a drawing of what a 2D array looks like and it's associated
coordinates. This 2D array we defined as a 3X3 which means our set up is will be a [2][2].</p>

<!--TODO: Place image here-->

<p>Above you can see the grid format with it's associated coordinates and how as you go one down in the column,
the coordinates goes [1][0] and when you go right of the row starting from [0][0] the coordinates go from [0][1]. From this
pattern we can see that means the coordinates are represented by [row][col]. In a 2D array it functions just like
a regular array with it's same properties except you are presented a grid array instead of a linearly aligned bucket array.
In order to make the 2D array like the one above and fill it in with "7" we need to use a nested for loop and the set up for that is...</p>

<pre>
    int my2Darray[3][3]; // Create a 2D Array
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
            // Fill in the 2D array with the integer 7
            my2Darray[i][j] = 7;
        }
    }
</pre>

<p>You can also set up a 2D array above by doing...</p>

<pre>
    int my2Darray[3][3] = {{7,7,7},{7,7,7},{7,7,7}};
</pre>

<p>Finally we can also index into a 2D array and retrieve values in it like a 1D array. Let's say we need to retrieve
the last integer value from a 5X5 2D array and print it. This means we want to retrieve the bottom right value of our "grid".
To do this our code will be...</p>
<pre>
    int value = my2Darray[4][4];
    printf("%d\n","value");
</pre>

<p>2D arrays are a very powerful tool that can be used to for many things like grid making for a board game or a another
way to store data. It's up to you on deciding which tool/array is right for you.</p>
