<h1>&nbsp;C Program Structure</h1>

<h2>&nbsp;Introduction</h2>

<p>In this lesson, you will learn about how a typically C program should be structured and why it is always good
to structure them based on what each file is doing to the program as a whole. This includes how you style your program
or how you organize your files in general.</p>

<h2>Program Structure</h2>
<p>When designing a larger program, it is always first good to separate the the main function into a separate file in order
to call it. The reason we want to do that is because it makes it easier for you or other programmers to see where does the program start before it starts
branching to different files or functionality based on what function is called in main. Next after you create a main inside the main
file, you want to develop your program and decide for each function, what functions are similar to each other so that you can create
a file that matches each functions "personality" trait. For example, if I create 2 functions that a special math formula I
created, I would make a math.c file and place those functions inside of them. Then I would create a header file called math.h
and link those 2 files together and finally I would then place the header file on top of the files I will use the math functions for
so that I can use their functionality which is math. The program structure would look like... </p>
