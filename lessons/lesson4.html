  Debugging and Troubleshooting
</h1>
</center>

<h2>
  Introduction
</h2>

<p> In this section you will learn the importance of debugging and troubleshooting
  code in C. There are a multitude of tools to support debugging, such as the use of an IDE
  and other third party software. A widely accepted debugging tool in the programming community
  is called GDB. <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/documentation/">Official GDB Website</a></li>
</p>

<h2>
  GDB
</h2>

<p>
  GDB is a powerful tool that allows you to debug code while it is being executed. Some of the main features
  include:
  <ol class="listElements">
    <p> Obtaining the values of variables at any given instance </p>
    <p> Call functions and reassign variables independent of the program's instructions </p>
    <p> Identifying the location in which bugs or crashes occur </p>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>
  There are many useful commands to learn in GDB which can all be found through
  the official documentation. Additionally, the manual page (<code> man gdb </code>)
  can be called upon from the terminal for quick documentation on commands and their uses.
</p>

<h2>
  Debugging Mentality
</h2>
<p>
  Even with many tools available to support debugging, it does not neccesarily
  provide the required skills to be effective at eliminating bugs. Like any other
  tool, it depends on the competence of the user and how that tool is being utilized.
</p>

<p>
  Whatever your approach to debugging is, it is important to break down your code into
  identifable segments to easily distinguish the functional code and the areas in which
  potential bugs occur.
