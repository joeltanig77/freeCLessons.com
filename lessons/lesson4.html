  Debugging and Troubleshooting
</p>
</h1>

<h2>
  Introduction
</h2>

<p> In this section you will learn the importance of debugging and troubleshooting
  code in C. There are a multitude of tools to support debugging, such as the use of an IDE
  and other third party software. A widely accepted debugging tool in the programming community
  is called GDB. <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/documentation/">Official GDB Website</a>
</p>

<h2>
  GDB
</h2>

<p>
  GDB is a powerful tool that allows you to debug code while it is being executed. Some of the main features
  include:
</p>
  <ol class="listElements">
    <li> Obtaining the values of variables at any given instance </li>
    <li> Call functions and reassign variables independent of the program's instructions </li>
    <li> Identifying the location in which bugs or crashes occur </li>
  </ol>

<p>
  There are many useful commands to learn in GDB which can all be found through
  the official documentation. Additionally, the manual page (<code> man gdb </code>)
  can be called upon from the terminal for quick documentation on commands and their uses.
</p>

<h2>
  Debugging Mentality
</h2>
<p>
  Even with many tools available to support debugging, it does not necessarily
  provide the required skills to be effective at eliminating bugs. Like any other
  tool, it depends on the competence of the user and how that tool is being utilized.
  Whatever your approach to debugging is, it is important to break down your code into
  identifiable segments to easily distinguish the functional code and the areas in which
  potential bugs occur.
</p>
<p>
  For example, if a troublesome variable's value is altered through the
  instructions of a function, it is good practice to observe the behavior of the variable
  before and after that function is called. Further extending this process involves the
  application of GDB. With the use of GDB, breakpoints can be set at specified locations
  to obtain the value of the variables at any given point. In the context of the variable
  example, GDB can be utilized to set a breakpoint before and after the function is called
  to identify the behavior of the variable and instructions within the function.

<p>
  The figure above is a visual representation of the previously stated issue. Notice
  how there are two distinct breakpoints that are addressing the locations of interest.
  As previously mentioned, this is before <i> and </i> after the troublesome variable is being altered by
  the function. Using these breakpoints, GDB can be utilized to obtain the value of
  the variable to understand the behavior throughout the progroam. This is one of many
  situations in which GDB can be utilized. Although it may be a simple issue, this is an
  excellent use of a debugger for approaching an issue as such.
  </p>

<b> General Tips </b>
<ol class="listElements">
  <li> Understand and eliminate one bug at a time. Attempting to eliminate
  numerous bugs at the same time can cause confusion and can create more bugs. </li>
  <li> If you are working with others, ask clarifying questions about their program
  before attempting to alter significant changes. A competent programmer will
  be able to describe how their program operates. </li>
  <li> Do not assume that everything works as intended. Be curious about the
  behavior of your code to ensure it works correctly </li>
  <li> If the bug occurs under certain situations, attempt to replicate
  that bug using a variety of parameters. In other words, make sure your program
  works for <i> all cases</i>. </li>
  <li> Temporary solutions are not meant to hold up. Document them well if you
  absolutely have to leave them in so you can apply a permanent fix in future edits. </li>
</ol>
  </p>

<h2>
Understanding Documentation
</h2>

<p> The C programming language is powerful, but there are times where it may
  work against you if you do not understand some specifics.
</p>
<p>
  It is important to read documentation on syntax and operations that are
  not clear to prevent bugs from occurring. It is a common mistake to continue
  to work on your program without occasionally checking the functionality of
  the logic, syntax, and intended operations.
</p>
<p>To improve your skills as a debugger
  you must also extend your reach as a troubleshooter. Before tools such as GDB
  are utilized to eliminate bugs, you should hopefully know what the operations
  in your program are attempting to accomplish rather than implementing a segments
  without reason. If an operation is unclear or you have suspicions about the
  functionality of a segment, it is strongly advised to take a step back to
  grasp an understanding of the code in question.
</p>
<p>
  In other words, using resources and manual pages is highly advised
  before jumping into the process of debugging.


</p>

<h2> Closing Thoughts </h2>

<p>
  To conclude, this lesson is merely the surface of what it takes to be a good
  debugger and troublshooter. There are many things to learn, but the most
  important thing to take away is that these skills do not develop right away.
</p>
<p>
  There are many things to consider when attempting to eliminate bugs and errors,
  so developing the mentality for the revision of your program can take considerable
  effort at first glance. There are many strategies and approaches to debugging/troubleshooting
  and I hope this lesson provided some insight in regards to the expectations of
  these issues. If you are interested in further applications of debugging,
  check out the <i> Advanced Debugging </i> section where issues such as memory leaks
  are also included.
