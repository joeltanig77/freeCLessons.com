  Debugging and Troubleshooting
</h1>

<h2>
  Introduction
</h2>

<p> In this section you will learn the importance of debugging and troubleshooting
  code in C. There are a multitude of tools to support debugging, such as the use of an IDE
  and other third party software. A widely accepted debugging tool in the programming community
  is called GDB. <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/documentation/">Official GDB Website</a>
</p>

<h2>
  GDB
</h2>

<p>
  GDB is a powerful tool that allows you to debug code while it is being executed. Some of the main features
  include:
</p>
  <ol class="listElements">
    <li> Obtaining the values of variables at any given instance </li>
    <li> Call functions and reassign variables independent of the program's instructions </li>
    <li> Identifying the location in which bugs or crashes occur </li>
  </ol>

<p>
  There are many useful commands to learn in GDB which can all be found through
  the official documentation. Additionally, the manual page (<code> man gdb </code>)
  can be called upon from the terminal for quick documentation on commands and their uses.
</p>

<h2>
  Debugging Mentality
</h2>
<p>
  Even with many tools available to support debugging, it does not necessarily
  provide the required skills to be effective at eliminating bugs. Like any other
  tool, it depends on the competence of the user and how that tool is being utilized.
  Whatever your approach to debugging is, it is important to break down your code into
  identifiable segments to easily distinguish the functional code and the areas in which
  potential bugs occur.
</p>
<p>
  For example, if a troublesome variable's value is altered through the
  instructions of a function, it is good practice to observe the behavior of the variable
  before and after that function is called. Further extending this process involves the
  application of GDB. With the use of GDB, breakpoints can be set at specified locations
  to obtain the value of the variables at any given point. In the context of the variable
  example, GDB can be utilized to set a breakpoint before and after the function is called
  to identify the behavior of the variable and instructions within the function.

  The figure above is a visual representation of the previously stated issue. Notice
  how there are two distinct breakpoints that are addressing the locations of interest.
  As previously mentioned, this is before <i> and </i> after the troublesome variable is being altered by
  the function. Using these breakpoints, GDB can be utilized to obtain the value of
  the variable to understand the behavior throughout the progroam. This is one of many
  situations in which GDB can be utilized. Although it may be a simple issue, this is an
  excellent use of a debugger for approaching an issue as such.
