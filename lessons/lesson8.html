<h1>&nbsp;Structures</h1>

<h2>&nbsp;Introduction </h2>
<p>
    In this lesson you will learn about structures. Structures provide versatile
    utility as an object by holding <i>multiple</i> types of data. Further extending
    this, structures are user made meaning that their utility depends on the
    data being stored within the structure and how that data is utilized. The data
    within a structure is known as "members".
</p>

<h2>&nbsp;Structure Syntax and Specifics </h2>
<p> Computers like to work in multiples of 4 bits very often. Due to this,
    the compiler will often add extra padding for the structure for the purpose of
    alignment. This is why invoking the method <code> sizeof() </code> may be
    misleading if padding is not accounted for directly.
</p>
<p> A structure can be made by using the abbreviation <code> struct </code>
    followed by the name of the structure. This creates the structure object
    and can now be used as an effective variable type. Within the structure,
    members can be applied to suit the needs of the structure. </p>
<p><strong> Example: </strong>You work for a car rental agency and need to keep track
    of the vehicles and information regarding the renter. Here are some basic
    examples of the type of information you might keep track of.</p>
<pre>
  // This struct will keep track of the renter information
  struct renter {
    char name[30]; // The renter's name
    char phoneNumber[10]; // The renter's phone number
    char address[60]; // The renter's physical address.
  }
  // This struct will keep track of the vehicle information and link the renter info.
  struct car {
    int year;
    char model[30];
    char color[30];
    renter renterInfo=NULL; // An instance of the renter class. Can be placed within the car.
    int gas=0;
  }

</pre>


<h2>&nbsp;Utility </h2>
<p> Now, these two structures can be combined together at the car rental agency
    to allow Sally to rent her dream car! Here is an example that ensures the information
    is kept track of securely, and that the car has enough gas for a decent trip!</p>
<pre>
    // This struct will keep track of the renter information
    struct renter {
      char name[30]; // The renter's name
      char phoneNumber[10]; // The renter's phone number
      char address[60]; // The renter's physical address.
    }
    // This struct will keep track of the vehicle information and link the renter info.
    struct car {
      int year;
      char model[30];
      char color[30];
      renter renterInfo = NULL; // An instance of the renter class. Can be placed within the car.
      int gas = 0;
    }

  int main() {
    // Initialize our Renter and her car.
    struct renter Sally;
    struct car Ferrari;

    // Get Sally's information before she rents the vehicle
    strcpy(Sally.name, "Sally"); // Copy Sally into the Sally.name member.
    strcpy(Sally.address, "Happy Street"); // Copy her address into the address member.
    strcpy(Sally.phoneNumber, 372-555-5933);

    // Input the Ferrari's information so it is understood throughout the code
    Ferrari.year=2010;
    strcpy(Ferrari.model, "Ferrari");
    strcpy(Ferrari.color, "Red");

    // Sally wants the Ferrari!

    Ferrari.renterInfo = Sally; // Sally is now a member of the Ferrari class.
    if(renterInfo & gas<50){ // If there is a renter (it is not NULL) and our gas is less than 50...
      Ferrari.gas=600; // Refill gas
    }

    // You are all set Sally!.
  }
</pre>
