  Structures
</h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p>
  In this lesson you will learn about structures. Structures provide versatile
  utility as an object by holding <i>multiple</i> types of data. Further extending
  this, structures are user made meaning that their utility depends on the
  data being stored within the structure and how that data is utilized. The data
  within a structure is known as "members".
</p>

<h2> Structure Syntax and Specifics </h2>
<p> Computers like to work in multiples of 4 very often. Due to this, 
<pre>
  struct car{
    int year;
    char model[30];
    char color[30];
    int gas;
  }
</pre>
