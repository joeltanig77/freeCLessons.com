<h1>&nbsp;Functions and Recursion</h1>
<h2>&nbsp;Introduction</h2>

<p>In this section you will learn about the basics of creating functions in order to create code that can be called
    multiple
    times which can eliminate the usage of <em>spaghetti code</em>. You will also learn about the power of recursion and
    how you can call a function within a function you are running which opens of a huge can or worms of programming
    logic which can
    all be solved in under 10 lines of code. This lesson will be split up into subsections so feel free to skip around.
</p>


<h2>&nbsp;Creating a Function</h2>
<p>The syntax for creating a function is...</p>

<pre>type functionName(args) {}</pre>

<p>The type would be one of the simple data types we covered like int, double, or void. The type you define
    represents the what function is suppose to return at the end of the function. If you return a type that a function
    was
    not expecting, this will result in an error. The args are what information you are passing into the function,
    so that it can use those pieces of information to run the code defined inside the function.</p>

<p>An example of a function called with a main would be...</p>

<pre>
    int formula (int a, int b) {
        // a is myNumber and b is herNumber
        return (a - b) + 100
    }

    int main {
        int myNumber = 10;
        int herNumber = 25;
        int answer = formula(myNumber,herNumber);
        printf("The answer from the formula is %d\n",answer);
        // Answer would be 115
    }

</pre>

<p>From the example above, the formula takes two arguments (a and b) and that those values are defined once the
    functions are called
    with it's arguments. Once the formula function is returned, the program goes back to where the formula was called
    and saves the return
    value to the variable "answer". Then it finally prints out the answer which is 115. The powerful thing about
    functions is that I can
    call "formula" anytime I need it without the need to copying and pasting the lines of code that are redundant over
    and over again. This keeps programs modularized and can most definitely help especially on a large scale program
    with many members working on the same code base.</p>

<p>Another example of creating a using functions would be... </p>

<pre>
    int funkyMath (int a, int b) {
        int temp = ((a+b) * 32) - ((a*b+55)*9);
        int ans = temp*temp;
        return ans;
    }

    int formula (int a, int b) {
        // a is myNumber and b is herNumber
        int ans = funkyMath(a,b);
        return (ans - b) + 100;
    }
    // A void function returns nothing
    void finalPrint() {
        printf("The answer from the formula is %d\n",answer);
    }

    int main {
        int myNumber = 10;
        int herNumber = 25;
        int answer = formula(myNumber,herNumber);
        finalPrint();
    }

</pre>

<p>Above is a larger example of how functions can be used which can help as you develop your program. As practice,
    try and find out what number will be printed at the end when the function fully runs.</p>


<h2>Recursion</h2>

<p>Recursion is one of the most powerful tools in programming. It grants the ability to solve large complex programming
    problems instead of 1000 lines of code, to maybe just a mere 3 lines of code all by just calling the function
    (yourself)
    again. To ease the confusion of (yourself) let's take a look of an simple look on the syntax of recursion...</p>

<pre>
    type recursiveFunction() {
        baseCase // The case to make the function stop calling itself

        // Statements

        type recursiveFunction // Calls itself
    }

    int main () {
        recursiveFunction()
    }
</pre>

<p>With the syntax above we will use this format to develop a program that uses recursion to find a
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/factorial">factorial</a> of a number. Because of how a factorial
    is calculated, the calculation always changes based on the number you want to find the factorial for which can be
    many lines of
    hardcoded code. But thanks to recursion this programming problem can be solved in under 10 lines. The code for
    calculating
    the factorial for any number would be...
</p>


<pre>
    int findFactorial (int a) {
        if (a == 0 || a == 1) {
            return 1;
        }
        return a*factorial(a-1);

}

    int main () {
        int userNum = 0;
        int finalAnswer = 0;
        printf("%s\n","Enter the number you want to find the factorial of");
        scanf("%d",&userNum);
        finalAnswer = findFactorial(userNum);
        printf("The factorial is %d\n",finalAnswer);
}
</pre>


<p>This is a classic example of why recursion is so powerful as if we wanted to find the factorial of 5 without using
    recursion,
    we would have to hard code the formula of 5*4*3*2*1. But with recursion, we do not have to ever hardcode that case,
    or any other case with a
    larger number to find a factorial as the function will always call itself and stop when the base case hits.
    Obviously there
    are more cases for recursion in which you will out as you develop more programs but for right now let this newly
    found
    information sink in because if you like it or not, recursion is one of the most powerful tricks <strong>YOU MUST
        MASTER.</strong></p>


<p>In later lessons we will shall use recursion more often when it comes to more advance data structures in C so stay
    tuned
    for that.</p>
