<h1>&nbsp;Functions and Recursion</h1>
<h2>&nbsp;Introduction</h2>

<p>In this section you will learn about the basics of creating functions in order to create code that can be called multiple
times which can eliminate the usage of <em>spaghetti code</em>. You will also learn about the power of recursion and
how you can call a function within a function you are running which opens of a huge can or worms of programming logic which can
all be solved in under 10 lines of code. This lesson will be split up into subsections so feel free to skip around.</p>


<h2>&nbsp;Creating a Function</h2>
<p>The syntax for creating a function is...</p>

<pre>type functionName(args) {}</pre>

<p>The type would be one of the simple data types we covered like int, double, or void. The type you define
represents the what function is suppose to return at the end of the function. If you return a type that a function was
not expecting, this will result in an error. The args are what information you are passing into the function,
so that it can use those pieces of information to run the code defined inside the function.</p>

<p>An example of a function called with a main would be...</p>

<pre>
    int formula (int a, int b) {
        // a is myNumber and b is herNumber
        return (a - b) + 100
    }

    int main {
        int myNumber = 10;
        int herNumber = 25;
        int answer = formula(myNumber,herNumber);
        printf("The answer from the formula is %d\n",answer);
        // Answer would be 115
    }

</pre>

<p>From the example above, the formula takes two arguments (a and b) and that those values are defined once the functions are called
with it's arguments. Once the formula function is returned, the program goes back to where the formula was called and saves the return
value to the variable "answer". Then it finally prints out the answer which is 115. The powerful thing about functions is that I can
call "formula" anytime I need it without the need to copying and pasting the lines of code that are redundant over
and over again. This keeps programs modularized and can most definitely help especially on a large scale program
with many members working on the same code base.</p>

<p>Another example of creating a using functions would be... </p>

<pre>
    int funkyMath (int a, int b) {
        int temp = ((a+b) * 32) - ((a*b+55)*9);
        int ans = temp*temp;
        return ans;
    }

    int formula (int a, int b) {
        // a is myNumber and b is herNumber
        int ans = funkyMath(a,b);
        return (ans - b) + 100;
    }
    // A void function returns nothing
    void finalPrint() {
        printf("The answer from the formula is %d\n",answer);
    }

    int main {
        int myNumber = 10;
        int herNumber = 25;
        int answer = formula(myNumber,herNumber);
        finalPrint();
    }

</pre>

<p>Above is a larger example of how functions can be used which can help as you develop your program. As practice,
try and find out what number will be printed at the end when the function fully runs.</p>


<h2>Recursion</h2>

<p>Recursion is one of the most powerful tools in programming. It grants the ability to solve large complex programming
 problems instead of 1000 lines of code, to maybe just a mere 3 lines of code all by just calling the function (yourself)
again. To ease the confusion of (yourself) let's take a look of an simple look on the syntax of recursion...</p>
