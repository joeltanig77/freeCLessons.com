<h1>&nbsp;Makefile</h1>

<h2>&nbsp;Introduction</h2>


<p>In this section you will learn about the basics of creating and running a Makefile in order to run your C program.
    While you may have been using gcc to run your programs though the terminal, this process can be annoying and quite
    tiresome
    as it requires you to type the same command over and over again if you do change one part of your program. However,
    with
    a Makefile this process makes it so you can store any commands you want to insert into the terminal including gcc
    all
    by just typing on the word Make into the terminal. This lesson will be split up into subsections so feel free
    to skip around.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;Creating a Makefile</h2>
<p>Creating a Makefile is very easy. On your terminal go into the directory of your program and in the terminal
    type... </p>

<pre>
    touch Makefile
</pre>

<p>This creates a Makefile and you are now ready to edit the Makefile how ever you want.</p>


<h2>Editing a Makefile</h2>
<p>Go ahead and edit the Makefile and copy and paste the commands you did in order to compile and run your C program.
    For example if my command for compiling was...</p>

<pre>
    gcc -g -std=c99 -Wall -pedantic -o insertAnyName yourNameOfYourFile.c
</pre>

<p>and the running command was...</p>

<pre>
    ./insertAnyName
</pre>

<p>My Makefile would then look like...</p>

<pre>
    yourNameOfYourFile:
         gcc -g -std=c99 -Wall -pedantic -o insertAnyName yourNameOfYourFile.c
    run:
        ./insertAnyName
</pre>

<p>With that you have created a super basic Makefile. Now if I wanted to compile my code I just make to type...</p>

<pre>
    make
</pre>

<p>Into my terminal and if I wanted to run my program I just have to type...</p>

<pre>
    make run
</pre>

<p>Makefiles are SUPER smart and know if you need to compile at all or not based on if you even changed your code.
    You also don't have to type make before you make run as if you try and run the code before compiling it will
    automatically
    try and compile the code and then run.</p>
