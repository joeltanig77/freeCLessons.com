  Pointers and Memory Addresses
</h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p> In this lesson, you will learn introductory applications of pointers, objects
  that retain the address of data stored in memory. Pointers are versatile and
  reliable, allowing you to communicate with variables and objects stored in memory
  throughout a multitude of <i>scopes</i>. Pointers have many uses and attributes
  that are not explicitly defined, which causes many misconceptions upon application.
  Further extending this, pointers at times can work directly with the hardware of
  the machine it is being executed on. This can open up dangerous situations, such
  as a pointer attempting to access a block of memory that is reserved for another
  object or process. Nevertheless, pointers are a fundemental part of C that often
  is used to distinguish C from other programming languages.

<h2> Memory Addresses </h2>
<p> Before the specifics of pointers are explained, it is important to understand
  memory addresses and how they apply to variables and objects as a whole. </p>
<p> Whenever an object or variable is initialized, it is stored at a location in memory.
  It is not explicit unless the ampersand(&) symbol is called upon the variable. </p>
<p> For example: </p>
<pre>
  int x = 5;
</pre>
<p> x is an integer variable with the value of 5. When this variable is initialized through
  this assignment, the address for the variable x is stored in some destination in memory
  within the computer. This address location is complicated, but there is more information
  regarding this in documentation about computer hardware and how programming languages
  communicate with it directly. Nevertheless, this address can be obtained using
  ampersand(&) and utilized through the use of pointers.

<h2> Pointer Logic and Conventions </h2>
<p> A pointer can apply to many different types of variables and objects.
  When a pointer is initialized, it stores the address of the object it is <i>pointing</i>
  to. Pointers are defined by declaring a data type and placing an asterisk afterwards,
  a variable name, and the address of the variable you wish to point to. Utilizing the
  previous example, a pointer for the variable x can be set up with the following: </p>
  <pre>
    int x = 5;
    int* xPtr = &x;
  </pre>
  <p> Now, the pointer xPtr is referencing the variable x in memory. With this direct
    information, xPtr can be utilized to reference the value of x in a multitude of
    scopes and operations without worrying about the complications of x being altered or
    lost. </p>

  <p> A useful application of pointers that fixes a complication with variables involves
    the use of function arguements. When functions require arguements
