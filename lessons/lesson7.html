<h1>&nbsp;Pointers and Memory Addresses</h1>

<h2>&nbsp;Introduction</h2>
<p> In this lesson, you will learn introductory applications of pointers, objects
  that retain the address of data stored in memory. Pointers are versatile and
  reliable, allowing you to communicate with variables and objects stored in memory
  throughout a multitude of <i>scopes</i>. Pointers have many uses and attributes
  that are not explicitly defined, which causes many misconceptions upon application.
  Further extending this, pointers at times can work directly with the hardware of
  the machine it is being executed on. This can open up dangerous situations, such
  as a pointer attempting to access a block of memory that is reserved for another
  object or process. Nevertheless, pointers are a fundamental part of C that often
  is used to distinguish C from other programming languages.
</p>

<h2>&nbsp;Memory Addresses</h2>
<p> Before the specifics of pointers are explained, it is important to understand
  memory addresses and how they apply to variables and objects as a whole. </p>
<p> Whenever an object or variable is initialized, it is stored at a location in memory.
  It is not explicit unless the ampersand(&) symbol is called upon the variable. </p>
<p> For example: </p>
<pre>
  int x = 5; // &x is the memory address of this variable.
</pre>
<p> x is an integer variable with the value of 5. When this variable is initialized through
  this assignment, the address for the variable x is stored in some destination in memory
  within the computer. This address location is complicated, but there is more information
  regarding this in documentation about computer hardware and how programming languages
  communicate with it directly. Nevertheless, this address can be obtained using
  ampersand(&) and utilized through the use of pointers.

<h2>&nbsp;Pointer Logic and Conventions</h2>
<p> A pointer can apply to many different types of variables and objects.
  When a pointer is initialized, it stores the address of the object it is <i>pointing</i>
  to. Pointers are defined by declaring a data type and placing an asterisk afterwards,
  a variable name, and the address of the variable you wish to point to. Utilizing the
  previous example, a pointer for the variable x can be set up with the following: </p>
  <pre>
    int x = 5;
    int* xPtr = &x;
  </pre>
  <p> Now, the pointer xPtr is referencing the variable x in memory. With this direct
    information, xPtr can be utilized to reference the value of x in a multitude of
    scopes and operations without worrying about the complications of x being altered or
    lost. To obtain the value of x from the pointer, you must first <i>dereference</i>
    the pointer with the use of an asterick:  </p>
<pre>
  printf("%d", *xPtr); //Print the INTEGER stored in xPtr(Not the address)
</pre>

  <p> A useful application of pointers that fixes a complication with variables involves
    the use of function arguements. When functions require arguements, the arguements themselves
    cannot be altered outside of the scope of the function without the use of pointers. Rather,
    the function is limited to what it is returning rather than altering the values of the arguements
    it is being provided. With the use of pointers, a function can alter the value of the object it
    is being provided <i>and</i> return a value when it is completed.
  </p>

  <p> Here is an example that elaborates on the complication previously described: </p>

  <pre>
    int increment(int a, int b){
      a+=1; //Increment the value of a
      b+=1; //Increment the value of b
    }

    int main(){
      x=3;
      y=6;
      increment(x,y);
      //x and y are unchanged because a and b do not leave the scope of the function.
    }
  </pre>

  <p> This presents a situation where the function does not successfully complete
    the desired operations. It may increment the variables <i>within</i> the function, however,
    it does not carry these changes to the scope of where it was called from (the main method in this case).
    Thankfully, pointers can mend this issue by requesting a <i>memory address</i>
    opposed to an integer.
  </p>

  <pre>
    int increment(int* a, int* b){
      *a+=1; //Dereference a. Increment the value of a
      *b+=1; //Dereference b. Increment the value of b
    }

    int main(){
      x=3;
      y=6;
      increment(&x,&y); // 1)Increment requires a pointer to be passed through.
      //2)Therefore, the address of x and y must be provided to reference the previous variables.

      //x and y ARE changed because they are being passed through as pointers!.
    }
  </pre>
