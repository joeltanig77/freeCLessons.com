<h1>Basic Logic in C</h1>
<body>
<h2>&nbsp;Introduction</h2>
<p>On this page you will learn about Basic logic in C and how these can be solved using if statements, boolean statements,
while loops and for loops. This lesson will be split up into subsections so feel free to skip around</p>

<h2>&nbsp;If, Elif and Else Statements</h2>
<p>An If statement is a programming conditional statement that passes if "True", and will run a set of statements/commands right after.
The If statement can also be deemed as "False", that in which a different set of statements/commands will run. These statements are
an XOR type which means you will never have this statement be both "True" and "False". Here is one example of an if
statement in C</p>
<pre>
    int usersNumber = 8;
    if (userNumber == 8) {
        printf("%s","You guessed my number! Go buy a lottery ticket or something!");
    }
    else {
        printf("%s", "You guessed the wrong number");
    }
</pre>
<p>What the code above did was checked if the variable <em>userNumber</em> was equal to the integer 8. Because it was,
the block inside the curly brackets executed the command which was to print the statement <em>You guessed my number! Go buy a lottery ticket or something!
    </em>. But, if that statement was not true, the else statement would be activated and the print statement of
<em>You guessed the wrong number</em> would be printed instead. Take note that you can also combine if statements as well like this...
</p>
<pre>
    int usersNumber = 10;
    if (userNumber > 0) {
        printf("%s","This number is greater than 0!\n");
    }
    else {
        printf("%s","You a negative number, try again");
        exit(0);
    }
    if (userNumber > 7) {
        printf("%s","This number is greater than 7!"\n);
    }
    if (userNumber == 10) {
        printf("%s", "10 is my number\n");
    }
</pre>
<p> From this example above, the first three if statements will activate with it's associated print statements, but the else
statement will not activate not unless the usersNumber was a negative number, that in which would trigger that print statement
and exit the program using exit(0).</p>
</body>
<p>There is also a conditional statement called <em>elif</em> or else if that activates only once
and can only be used when chained with other elif or if statements. Here is an example on how elif is used...</p>
<pre>
    int usersNumber = 10;
    if (usersNumber == 8) {
        printf("%s", "The user's number is 8");
    }
    elif (usersNumber > 8) {
        printf("%s", "The user's number is greater than 8");
    }
    elif (usersNumber == 10) {
        printf("%s", "The user's number is 10");
    }
    else {
        printf("%s", "The number is not close, please try again");
        exit(0);
    }
</pre>
<p>If we ran this code, the only statement that would have been printed from the terminal is
<em>"The user's number is greater than 8"</em> and it will never reach <em>The user's number is 10</em>. As stated previously,
    elif only runs once in a block of if statements and so if a conditional statement is "True" for a elif,
    it will run that set of commands inside the curly brackets then exit immediately. You will learn quickly as
you develop programs why elif will later on become your best friend for certain situations.</p>
<h3>Nested if statement</h3>
<p>Finally, you can also nest your if statements, in other words,
    have an if statement inside an if statement. Below is sample code of what a
nested if statement would look like...</p>

<pre>
    int myNumber1 = 50;
    int myNumber2 = 100;
    if (myNumber1 == 50) {
        if (myNumber2 = 100) {
            printf("%s\n","Nested if statement!");
        }
    }
    else {
        printf("%s\n","Error");
    }
</pre>

<h2>&nbsp;Comparison and Equality Operations</h2>
<p>In the examples above you may have realized we used equality and comparisons tests
inside our if statements to make check if the statement would validate to "true" or "false". Below are a table of
    comparisons and equality tests you can use for your if statements or even while loops which will be explained
    more later in this lesson.
</p>

<table style="width: 100%">
    <tr>
        <th style="text-align-last: left">Operations</th>
        <th style="text-align-last: left">Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&lt;</td>
        <td>Checks is the first argument is less than the second argument</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&lt;=</td>
        <td>Checks if the first argument is less than or equal to than the second argument</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&gt;</td>
        <td>Checks if the first argument is greater than the second argument</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&gt;=</td>
        <td>Checks if the first argument is greater than or equal to than the second argument</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>==</td>
        <td>Checks if the first argument is equal to the second</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>!=</td>
        <td>Checks if the first argument is not equal to the second argument</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>||</td>
        <td>A logical "or" statement that can be combined with the comparison or equality statements above</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&&</td>
        <td>A logical "and" statement that can be combined with the comparison or equality statements above</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p><strong>
    Note: These comparisons directly do not work for strings, to
    check for equality for strings check out our C library lesson.</strong></p>
<p>Below are some examples of how these comparisons are used in an if statement. Assume we need to make a program
that took two numbers from the user and printed statements based on how close his guesses were to the
programs set number</p>
<pre>
    // Let us assume userGuessOne = 5 and userGuessTwo = 10 which we got from taking user input
    int correctNumberOne = 5;
    int correctNumberTwo = 12;
    if ((userGuessOne == correctNumberOne) && (userGuessTwo == correctNumberTwo)) {
        printf("%s\n","You guessed both the right numbers!");
    }
    elif ((userGuessOne == correctNumberOne) && (userGuessTwo < correctNumberTwo)) {
        printf("%s\n","The first number is correct but the second number is less than the correct number");
    }
    elif ((userGuessTwo == correctNumberTwo) && (userGuessOne < correctNumberOne)) {
        printf("%s\n","The second number is correct but the first number is less than the correct number");
    }
    elif ((userGuessOne == 50) || (userGuessTwo == 100)) {
        printf("%s\n","These numbers are not even close");
    }
    else {
        printf("%s\n","Try again");
    }
</pre>

<p>Here is some examples of how the not (!) comparison is used</p>
<pre>
    if (!(userGuessOne == 25)) || (!(userGuessTwo == 25)) {
        printf("%s","You did not guess the bad numbers");
    }
</pre>
<p>The example above checks if the number is NOT 25 based on the ! in front of the expression. The ! inverses
any logical expression so if the statement did evaluate to true, the ! would then evaluate the statement to false.
This example above is logically the same as...</p>
<pre>
    if (userGuessOne != 25) || (userGuessTwo != 25) {
        printf("%s","You did not guess the bad numbers");
    }
</pre>


<h2>&nbsp;Booleans in C</h2>
<p>In other programming languages like Java, booleans variables are a value that can store either "true" ot "false".
In C however, this is possible as well but instead of storing the value as true or false, we use an int type with the
value 1 or 0 to define true or false in C. We use booleans mainly as a flag which can turn on or off
based on when we want it to activate. Here is a simple example of how we define and use a boolean</p>

<pre>
    // Here we are defining our flag as "False"
    int flag = 0;
    int correctNumberOne = 5;
    if (correctNumberOne == 5) {
        flag = 1;
    }
    if (flag == 1) {
        // If the flag is set as "True" then we print this statement
        printf("%s","You guessed the correct number");
    }
    if (flag == 0) {
        // If the flag is set as "False" then we print this statement
        printf("%s","You guessed the incorrect number");
    }
</pre>

<p>We can also do the example code above by just using booleans directly instead of setting it to 1 or 0 like
what we did above by doing...</p>

<pre>
    int flag = 0;
    int correctNumberOne = 5;
    if (correctNumberOne == 5) {
        flag = !flag;
    }
    if (flag) {
        // If the flag is set as "True" then we print this statement
        printf("%s","You guessed the correct number");
    }
    if (!flag) {
        // If the flag is set as "False" then we print this statement
        printf("%s","You guessed the incorrect number");
    }
</pre>

<p>Booleans are an amazing tool for basic logic and will be used more in the later lessons for when we
use loops.</p>
<p><strong>Note: When comparing a boolean, the integer 1 is defined as "true" and any other number but one will
be defined as a "false"</strong></p>

<h2>&nbsp;While loops</h2>
<p>Loops are a tool in C or in any programming language that can do tasks a million times over without yourself doing
a task a million times over. The way you loop things can change the way you solve programming challenges and it takes
some finesse to try and develop the perfect loop. Here is a simple example of a while loop in action...</p>

<pre>
    int beerCount = 100;
    while (beerCount > 0) {
        beerCount = beerCount - 1 // this is also the same as (beerCount -= 1)
        printf("%d, %s\n", beerCount, "bottles of beer in the wall");
    }
    printf("%s\n","There is no beer left!");
</pre>

<p>The while loop is set up as...</p>
<pre>
    while(comparison) {
        statements
    }
</pre>

<p>As you can see above, these loops in are life savors when it comes to doing a command over and over again as
instead of the programmer doing 100 print statements, the programmer just has to set a while loop
that sets up the 100 print statements.</p>

<p>You can also do a while loop that has argument of a boolean variable. Here is an example of that in action...</p>

<pre>
    int flag = 1; // Set the boolean flag to "true" which is represented by the integer 1
    int count = 10;
    while (flag) {
        if (count == 0) {
            printf("%s\n","The count is over");
            flag = 0;
        }
        elif (count != 0) {
            printf("%s\n","%d\n","The count is", count);
            count -= 1;
        }
    }
    // We get here when the flag is set to 0 or "false"
</pre>

<p>Finally, you can also have while loops that loop forever with a while true statement, these statements are used when
you want to keep doing something until an argument is met and that is when we call a break to stop the while loop from occurring.
Here is a example of a while true loop in action...</p>

<pre>
    int count = 100;
    while(1) { // This loop will go one forever, so always be sure you stop the loop with a break
        printf("%s","%d\n","The count is",count);
        count -= 1;
        if (count == 0) {
            printf("%s\n","The count is over");
            break;  // Exit the while loop
        }
    }
    printf("%s\n","I am free!!!!");
</pre>

<p>As you can see above, we recoded the second example of the while loop but used a while true loop
instead and used the command break to stop the while loop from happening. In future lessons you will see in detail why
how these tools like break is useful for future programs you will create.</p>

<p><strong>Note: Remember, break statements exit the while loop from the point you create it, make sure you place the break
properly or else your program may skip parts in your code that you indented to run.</strong></p>


<h2>&nbsp;For loops</h2>
<p>A for loop is another type of loop like a while loop that has a starting point and and an end point. Think of it as a
more advanced while loop that has more control in when it stops. Here is an example of a for loop in action.</p>

<pre>
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        // Prints the number 1-9
        printf("%s","%d\n","Iteration",i);
    }
</pre>

<p>You can also do for loops by comparing an int variable and incrementing by a integer that is not 1
An example would be...</p>

<pre>
    for (int i = 2; i <= 10; i += 2) {
        // Prints the integers 2-10
        printf("%d\n",i);
    }
</pre>

<p>A for loop is set up as...</p>
<pre>
    for(start variable, comparison, incrementer) {
        statements
    }
</pre>
<ul>
    <li>The start variable is at what integer you want to for loop to start at</li>
    <li>The comparison is what compares the start variable to the target integer. If the comparison is "false" at any point
    the for loop stops</li>
    <li>The incrementer is a counter and you set it to how many you want to increase the incrementer by after
        each iteration of the for loop. The ++ means increase by one</li>
</ul>
<p>While the for loop can do the exact same things as a while loop, a for loop allows more control and will be used
often than a whole loop in a program. Based on the situation, you will have to decide what it best for your program, a while loop
or a for loop.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;Nested For loops</h3>
<p>You can also nest for loops which is a for loops inside a for loop. These loops are used mainly for 2D arrays which we will talk
about in the next lesson of Arrays and 2D Arrays. Below is the format of what a nested for loops looks like...</p>

<pre>
    for(start variable, comparison, incrementer) {
        statements
            for(start variable, comparison, incrementer) {
                statements
            }
    }
</pre>
