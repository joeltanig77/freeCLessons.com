<h2>&nbsp;Introduction</h2>
<p>On this page you will learn about Basic logic in C and how these can be solved using if statements, boolean statements,
while loops and for loops. This lesson will be split up into subsections so feel free to skip around</p>

<h2>&nbsp;If, Elif and Else Statements</h2>
<p>An If statement is a programming conditional statement that passes if "True", and will run a set of statements/commands right after.
The If statement can also be deemed as "False", that in which a different set of statements/commands will run. These statements are
an XOR type which means you will never have this statement be both "True" and "False". Here is one example of an if
statement in C</p>
<pre>
    int usersNumber = 8;
    if (userNumber == 8) {
        printf("%s","You guessed my number! Go buy a lottery ticket or something!");
    }
    else {
        printf("%s", "You guessed the wrong number");
    }
</pre>
<p>What the code above did was checked if the variable <em>userNumber</em> was equal to the integer 8. Because it was,
the block inside the curly brackets executed the command which was to print the statement <em>You guessed my number! Go buy a lottery ticket or something!
    </em>. But, if that statement was not true, the else statement would be activated and the print statement of
<em>You guessed the wrong number</em> would be printed instead. Take note that you can also combine if statements as well like this...
</p>
<pre>
    int usersNumber = 10;
    if (userNumber > 0) {
        printf("%s","This number is greater than 0!\n");
    }
    else {
        printf("%s","You a negative number, try again");
        exit(0);
    }
    if (userNumber > 7) {
        printf("%s","This number is greater than 7!"\n);
    }
    if (userNumber == 10) {
        printf("%s", "10 is my number\n");
    }
</pre>
<p> From this example above, the first three if statements will activate with it's associated print statements, but the else
statement will not activate not unless the usersNumber was a negative number, that in which would trigger that print statement
and exit the program using exit(0).</p>
</body>
<p>Finally there is also a conditional statement called <em>elif</em> or else if that activates only once
and can only be used when chained with other elif or if statements. Here is an example on how elif is used...</p>
<pre>
    int usersNumber = 10;
    if (usersNumber == 8) {
        printf("%s", "The user's number is 8");
    }
    elif (usersNumber > 8) {
        printf("%s", "The user's number is greater than 8");
    }
    elif (usersNumber == 10) {
        printf("%s", "The user's number is 10");
    }
    else {
        printf("%s", "The number is not close, please try again");
        exit(0);
    }
</pre>
<p>If we ran this code, the only statement that would have been printed from the terminal is
<em>"The user's number is greater than 8"</em> and it will never reach <em>The user's number is 10</em>. As stated previously,
    elif only runs once in a block of if statements and so if a conditional statement is "True" for a elif,
    it will run that set of commands inside the curly brackets then exit immediately. You will learn quickly as
you develop programs why elif will later on become your best friend.</p>
