<h2>&nbsp;Introduction</h2>
<p>On this page you will learn about Basic logic in C and how these can be solved using if statements, boolean statements,
while loops and for loops. This lesson will be split up into subsections so feel free to skip around</p>

<h2>&nbsp;If and Else Statements</h2>
<p>An If statement is a programming conditional statement that passes as "True", will run a set of statements/commands right after.
The If statement can also be deemed as "False", that in which a different set of statements will run. These statements are
an XOR type which means you will never have this statement be both "True" and "False". Here is one example of an if
statement in C</p>
<pre>
    int usersNumber = 8;
    if (userNumber == 8) {
        printf("%s","You guessed my number! Go buy a lottery ticket or something!");
    }
    else {
        printf("%s", "You guessed the wrong number");
    }
</pre>
<p>What the code above did was checked if the variable <em>userNumber</em> was equal to the integer 8. Because it was,
the block inside the curly brackets executed the command which was to print the statement <em>You guessed my number! Go buy a lottery ticket or something!
    </em>. But, if that statement was not true, the else statement would be activated and the print statement of
<em>You guessed the wrong number</em> would be printed instead. Take note that you can also combine if statements as well like this...
</p>
<pre>
    int usersNumber = 10;
    if (userNumber > 0) {
        printf("%s","This number is greater than 0!\n");
    }
    else {
        printf("%s","You a negative number, try again");
        exit(0);
    }
    if (userNumber > 7) {
        printf("%s","This number is greater than 7!"\n);
    }
    if (userNumber == 10) {
        printf("%s", "10 is my number\n");
    }
</pre>
<p> From this example above, the first three if statements will activate with it's associated print statements, but the else
statement will not activate not unless the usersNumber was a negative number, that in which would trigger that print statement
and exit the program using exit(0). </p>
