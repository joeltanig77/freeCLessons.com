<h2>&nbsp;Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to the first lesson on C. On this page, you will learn about the syntax of C, simple data
types, how to compile C code, and how to print in the terminal. This lesson will
be split up into subsections so feel free to skip around.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;Print Statements in C</h2>
<p>First lets start of with something relatively simple and that is printing a statement in C. Tou can follow along if you want
    by making a new C file and typing in the C code we are about to write. The first thing we need
to do is write a main function which is what your program will run first. The function will look like...</p>

<pre>
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt
    int main() {
    printf("%s","Hello World\n");
 }</pre>
<p>Don't worry about what the include statement or what the %s is doing, just know that we
    need it in order to use the print function and to print a string in C. Also to note that the "\n" indicates that we want
    to print a new line after "Hello World". We can then run it by opening our terminal and cd all the way to our program.
    Once we are in the folder of our program we can type this into
    our terminal...(note you must have <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/install/download.html">gcc</a> installed for this to work)
</p>
<pre>gcc -g -std=c99 -Wall -pedantic -o insertAnyName yourNameOfYourFile.c</pre>
<p>Don't worry about what this line above really does, just know that it takes your C code, and turns it
into a object file for you to run.</p>
<p>We finally run the program by typing in this in our terminal</p>
<pre>./insertAnyName</pre>
<p>After doing this you should get the output of "Hello World" on the terminal. Congrats you made your first program! Below
    are more examples of how printf can be used.</p>

<h3>Print Statement in C with a int and a string</h3>
<p>Above we printed a string of "Hello World". If you wanted to print an integer and a string together, we can edit
the above code to say...</p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt
    int main() {
    printf("My favorite number is %d\n", 94);
 }</pre>
<p>Again to note a %s is equal to a string format and  %d is equal to a decimal/integer formatter which is how C
knows which type we want to print. We will talk more about why data types like strings and integers are so important to
memorize later on but for right now just know that this is how you print in C. %s was not needed for the example above
as we did not use a variable to concatenate a string but for a more complex program you will see why %s is needed.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;Simple Data Types in C</h2>
<h3>&nbsp;Strings</h3>
<p>In you did the following exercise above you might have recognized why we did "" on the printf statement. The reason
that is needed is because the "" means that the letters inside we are dealing with are a String datatype.
A String datatype is an array of characters that ends with a null terminator of '\0'. This terminator is important as it tells
the program the string has ended and it does not need to look further for more data. This fine detail will be important for lessons
later on for other functions like strlen (string length) and scanf. </p>
<h3>&nbsp;Integers</h3>
<p>An integer just like in math is a whole number that can be positive, negative, or a zero. As long as it does not have
a decimal, the number is stated to be a integer datatype. Example include 100, 234, and -38462. <strong> Warning: integers
    can be strings  if you allow it to be, be careful on where you wrap your quotations. If they are wrapped in
    quotations, they will follow the rules of strings and you will not be able to do math with them. </strong> </p>
<h3>&nbsp;Doubles</h3>
<p>A double is a number that contains a decimal point. They can contain 15 digits in total and you can do math with this type. If you want
to print a double, you can do that by using the %f format specifier when you are using printf</p>
<h2>&nbsp;Challenge</h2>
<p>Print out the following statement in the terminal</p>
<pre>Robert is 22 years old and Sophia in 57 years old. They both adopted a son named Clifford who decided to
go into a medical degree at a very young age of 7.1323 years old.</pre>
