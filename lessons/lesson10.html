<h1>&nbsp;Headers</h1>

<h2>&nbsp;Introduction</h2>

<p>In this section you will learn about how header files work in C and how these header files can be used to organize
    large programs in order for code to be modularized for other programmers to use and yourself
    to use. In retrospect, header files are just a include file that takes functions defined by the program and calls
    them. When the
    function is called, it then calls the functionality from another file and returns as a regular old function. In even
    more simple
    terms, anytime you create a include statement on top of your c file, it just copy's and paste code that was in the
    file
    you included.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;Creating a header file</h2>
<p>In order to create a header file, you must first create a .h file and call it the same name as the the C file you
    intend
    to have the functionality of your header file functions you define. For example if I wanted to do these steps above
    I
    would...</p>

<p>In the terminal I would type... if my functionality of my header file would be located in foo.c</p>

<pre>
    touch foo.h
</pre>

<p>Next on top of my header file, I need to put...</p>
<pre>
    #ifndef FOO_H
    #define FOO_H
</pre>

<p>What #ifndef means is "if not defined" what this does is check if the header file is already defined in the C file
    you are trying to implement. The reason you do this is because without this statement the compiler may "double
    include" code
    which is very bad and can cause many errors and warnings. After the #ifndef we define the header file as FOO_H in
    this case and below define the functions we want to implement for our header file. As an example, let's assume I
    have
    I have a getWord function that is defined in foo.c that I want to define in my foo.h file. If I wanted to do that I
    would... </p>

<p>Inside foo.c I see... </p>
<pre>
    int getWord(char oneWord[10000], int i, char wordArray[500][500], int *size) {
        char makeWord[10000];
        i++;
        strcpy(makeWord, "Dummy Value");
        strcpy(oneWord, "Dummy Value");
        *size += 1;
        scanf("%s", makeWord);
        // If the word is == to "zzzzz" stop reading the file
        if (strcmp(makeWord, "zzzzz") == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        // If dummy value == dummy value, we are at the end of the text file
        if (strcmp(makeWord, oneWord) != 0) {
            strcpy(oneWord, makeWord); // Put one word in the array
            strcpy(wordArray[i], oneWord);
            return getWord(oneWord, i, wordArray, size);
        }
        return 0;
    }
</pre>

<p>I would take the first line of the function and copy it which would be... </p>
<pre>
    int getWord(char oneWord[10000], int i, char wordArray[500][500], int *size)
</pre>

<p>I would finally go back to be header file of foo.h and paste that line with a semicolon. I would
    also comment above above that line to tell other programmers or myself of what that function does.</p>

<pre>
    /* Gets the word from the text file and stores it into the array */
    int getWord(char oneWord[10000], int i, char wordArray[500][500], int *size);
</pre>

<p>For the rest of the header file I would repeat that process until I have included every single function inside foo.c
    and at the
    end put #endif to conclude the header file. Foo.h would now look like...</p>

<pre>
    #ifndef FUNC_H
    #define FUNC_H

    /* Gets the word from the text file and stores it into the array */
    int getWord(char oneWord[10000], int i, char wordArray[500][500], int *size);

    /* Looks into the array and keeps counts of instances for each word in the array  */
    int compareArrays(char wordArray[500][500], int instancesOfWords[500], int size);

    /* Clean the junk from the array */
    int clean2DArray(char array[500][500]);
    /* Checks if the item in the repeatedWords array is already counted, this is to stop repeated words */
    int isItInTheArray(char wordArray[500][500], char repeatedWords[500][500], int i);

    /* Clean up the compare array to contain only unique words and counts */
    int cleanUpCompare(char wordArray[500][500], const int instancesOfWords[500], char repeatedWords[500][500],
                       int newInstancesOfWords[500], int size, int *newSize);

    /* A helper function that finds the max of the count instance and saves it to the top5RankSize which stores the
                        count for each word in our UI */
    int findMax(int newInstancesOfWords[500], int top5RankSize[500], int size, int *i, const int *nextSpot);

    /* Finds the top 5 words and stores them into the array */
    int
    topFiveWords(char repeatedWords[500][500], int newInstancesOfWords[500], int top5RankSize[500], int newSize, int size,
                 int *i, char top5RankWord[500][500]);

    /* Rearranges the array to alphabetical order and prints the word as well as the occurrences */
    int rearrangeToAlphabetOrderAndPrint(char arrangeToAlphabet[500][500], char organizedToAlphabet[500][500], int size,
                                                      int top5RankSize[500], int *finalSpot);
    /* Finds which words has the same number of occurrences and stores the number into an array of top5RankSize */
    int findSameNumberOfOccurrence(char top5RankWord[500][500], int top5RankSize[500], int size);

    /* A function for printing the UI in the terminal */
    void printUi();

    #endif
</pre>

<p>Finally to link both the c file and the header file I need to put the include statement for the header file I just
    fully completed into foo.c. The top of foo.c will finally look like...</p>

<pre>
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &lt;string.h&gt;
    #include "func.h"

    // Start of functions here
</pre>

<p>With these steps you can now successfully create a header file and call this file from anywhere with the
    functionality
    of the linked C file. For example if I wanted to call this file that just contains my main, all I have to do
    is place the include statement (#include "func.h") on top the C file like this...</p>

<pre>
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &lt;string.h&gt;
    #include "func.h"
    // This is the main which calls all other functions throughout the program
    int main() {
        char oneWord[10000];
        char wordArray[500][500];
        char repeatedWords[500][500];
        char top5RankWord[500][500];
        int top5RankSize[500];
        int instancesOfWords[500];
        int newInstancesOfWords[500];
        int i = -1;
        int size = 0;
        int newSize = 0;
        printUi();
        getWord(oneWord, i, wordArray, &size);
        compareArrays(wordArray, instancesOfWords, size);
        cleanUpCompare(wordArray, instancesOfWords, repeatedWords, newInstancesOfWords, size, &newSize);
        topFiveWords(repeatedWords, newInstancesOfWords, top5RankSize, newSize, size, &i, top5RankWord);
        findSameNumberOfOccurrence(top5RankWord, top5RankSize, size);
    }
</pre>

<h3>&nbsp;Practical Usage of Headers</h3>

<p>Anytime you need to develop a large program with many functionality that can relate to each other, it is very
    important
    to develop header files for them as it will not only help you if you take an extensive break from a program, but
    also
    to other programmers who may work on the same program as you. With more development in larger programs this skill
    of creating an connecting header files will be the key in becoming not only a skillful programmer but also a
    organized one as well. If you created a C program before, try reorganizing that same program using header
    files as practice.</p>
