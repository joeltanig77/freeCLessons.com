<h2>&nbsp;Introduction</h2>
<p>In this section you will learn about the C library and the functions it has to offer. We will only go over the main ones
almost every programmer uses. For more information about C library's we will not be covering in this lesson check out
the official <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_mono/libc.html">C library website for more information</a>.</p>



<h2>&nbsp;The C Standard library</h2>
<p>The C Standard library is a group of functions already pre-made by the developers of the
languages of C that you may freely use. Because of this, it is on us as developers to use these
as they are stress tested, reliable, and (almost mostly) bug free. Below is a chart
of the library's you can use and implement for your programs. To call a library
place &lt;libraryNameHere&gt; on top of the file you are programming in.</p>
