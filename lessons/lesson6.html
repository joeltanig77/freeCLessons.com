<h1>The C Standard Library </h1>

<h2>&nbsp;Introduction</h2>
<p>In this section you will learn about the C library and the functions it has to offer. We will only go over the main ones
almost every programmer uses. For more information about C library's we will not be covering in this lesson check out
the official <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_mono/libc.html">C library website for more information</a>.</p>


<h2>&nbsp;Uses</h2>
<p>The C Standard library is a group of functions already pre-made by the developers of the
languages of C that you may freely use. Because of this, it is on us as developers to use these
as they are stress tested, reliable, and (almost mostly) bug free. Below is a chart
of the library's you can use and implement for your programs. These of course are not all the library's
    C has and the chart below is the future library's we will use. To call a library
place &lt;libraryNameHere&gt; on top of the file you are programming in. These library's do not transfer to other
files in your project so always make sure to import them on top of the files you are working on. </p>

<h2>&nbsp;The library's we will be using for future lessons</h2>
