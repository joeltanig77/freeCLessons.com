<h1>
  Dynamic Memory
</h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p> In this lesson you will learn about dynamic memory. Up until now, all of the
  space allocated in memory that you have been learning is known as <i>static allocation</i>.
  Static allocation is useful because it cleans up after itself when the program exits, but
  is not as versatile as dynamic memory. For example, if one were to allocate 30 bytes for
  a name space and a user enters a name more than 30 characters, there would not be enough space
  to contain their name. This can be mended with the use of dynamic memory. With dynamic memory,
  the namespace would be able to extend <i>dynamically</i> to the needs of the program, without
  extending into space that is harmful. </p>

<h2> Dynamic Memory Functions </h2>
<p> In order to utilize dynamic memory in your program, you must first include
  the <code>stdlib.h</code> library, as you have previously learned from the
  <a href="../lessons/lesson6.html">C Library</a></li> lesson. This library
  provides the required functions for dynamic memory, and it is a staple within
  the C programming community. </p>

  <h3> Malloc </h3>
  <p> Malloc is the main memory allocation function. It applies to most circumstances
    and can easily be called upon any data type desired. </p>
