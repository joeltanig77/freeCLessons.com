<h1>&nbsp;Dynamic Memory</h1>

<h2>&nbsp;Introduction </h2>
<p> In this lesson you will learn about dynamic memory. Up until now, all of the
  space allocated in memory that you have been learning is known as <i>static allocation</i>.
  Static allocation is useful because it cleans up after itself when the program exits, but
  is not as versatile as dynamic memory. For example, if one were to allocate 30 bytes for
  a name space and a user enters a name more than 30 characters, there would not be enough space
  to contain their name. This can be mended with the use of dynamic memory. With dynamic memory,
  the namespace would be able to extend <i>dynamically</i> to the needs of the program, without
  extending into space that is harmful. </p>

<h2>&nbsp;Dynamic Memory Functions </h2>
<p> In order to utilize dynamic memory in your program, you must first include
  the <code>stdlib.h</code> library, as you have previously learned from the
  <a href="../lessons/lesson6.html">C Library</a></li> lesson. This library
  provides the required functions for dynamic memory, and it is a staple within
  the C programming community. </p>

  <h3>&nbsp;Malloc </h3>
  <p> Malloc is the main memory allocation function. It applies to most circumstances
    and can easily be called upon any data type desired. </p>
  <p> To put it (not so)simply, Malloc will allocate memory through the use of <i>void pointers</i>. These pointers
    can be cast to any data type that your program requires with the use of the right syntaxing. Further extending this,
    the arguments for malloc require the size of the data type you are attempting to allocate multiplied by the number of
    elements of that specific data type Due to the memory being <i> dynamic</i>, it is perfectly valid to only allocate
    enough space for one variable so you do not use up more than you need. An example of this would go as follow for an
    integer pointer(Note: You can easily allocate more space if you need to store more integers to this pointer with the use of
    commands that will be explained shortly):

<p> In addition to just allocating space for one item, it can be allocated for multiple
  elements at once. For example, if you wish to allocate memory for 5 integers initially,
  you would need to invoke the <code> sizeof()</code> method to obtain the size of an integer,
   and then multiply it by 5. The syntaxing would look something as the following:
</p>
<pre>
  int* ptr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int)*5);
</pre>
